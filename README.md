# moviedb 

`moviedb` is a python wrapper to represent the [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com) API. It helps you to get files i.e. Movies/TV-Series information from IMDB by scraping.

Differences compared to [pymoviedb](https://github.com/itsmehemant7/PyMovieDb):
- Includes language support. (@9Mad-Max5)
- Returns `json` instead of `str`. (@Loukious)
- Many parsing errors are fixed. (@Loukious)

## Documentation 
**1) Getting a Movie/Tv-Series info :-**

Use ``` get_by_name(<name>, tv=False) ``` method to get information of a movie/TV-Series.

The ``` tv ``` is an optional argument, if ``` tv=True``` it will get data from ```TV Series``` files only.

On the other hand, if ```tv=False``` (default), it will find your file in ```Movies + TV Series``` results
```python
>>> from moviedb import IMDB
>>> imdb = IMDB()
>>> res = imdb.get_by_name('House Of The Dragon', tv=True)
>>> print(res)
>>> {

  "name": "House of the Dragon",

So far, so good.\n\nThe music is sufficiently different to be fresh while remaining recognizable. The production quality and cinematography are as expected - fantastic, epic and awe inspiring, aside from a couple of excessively dark scenes that were over and done with very quickly.\n\nThere is gore aplenty. Nudity, vomit, sex and depravity. Incidental background humor. A promise of things to come.\n\nThe casting seems to be on point - I saw no issue with any of the characters, and the leads were well chosen for their roles.\n\nThe writing seems to be up to par. As an introduction, this episode was written and directed well. I want to see and know more - a good sign.\n\nSo far I&apos;m pleased with this return to the land of Westeros. Valar morghulis!",

    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll admit i&apos;ve skewed my rating a bit, i&apos;ve ranked it so highly rated based on the fact I knew what movie I was buying a ticket for. I&apos;m not rating it highly because it&apos;s a modern classic, i&apos;m doing it based on wanting to see a funny and entertaining action movie and in that respect it delivers pretty much everything I went to the cinema for.\n\nThe premise of the film is basic, the cast is solid, the characters are excellent including mini side characters. The humour has a few misses but generally it is a pretty funny movie throughout, they also pay off everything that is set up along the way which makes it a satisfying watch. Also if you are yet to see it, stay through the credits as it does tie up one or two of those loose ends.\n\nThe slight downside for me, were that the run time does sag a little toward the end but it is over 2 hours long and otherwise moved along at a steady rate.",
